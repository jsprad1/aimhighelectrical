## Pain Points Section

### Section Headline
Is Your Home's Electrical System Holding You Back?

### Pain Points

| Pain Point | Agitation | Solution Hint |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Flickering lights or outlets that don't work | That flickering isn't just annoying — it's a warning sign. Faulty wiring can lead to electrical fires or dangerous shocks, putting your family at risk. | Our expert troubleshooting pinpoints the problem fast and fixes it right, giving you peace of mind. |
| Outdated electrical panel can't handle modern demands | Running the dishwasher while charging your EV trips the breaker? Your 20-year-old panel wasn't built for today's power-hungry homes. Living with constant breaker trips is frustrating and limits what you can do. | We upgrade panels to modern capacity, so your home can handle everything from smart devices to electric vehicles without a hitch. |
| Can't find a reliable electrician who shows up | You've been burned before — contractors who don't call back, show up late, or do sloppy work. Your time is valuable, and you need someone professional you can count on. | As a veteran-owned business, we bring military discipline to every appointment. We show up on time, communicate clearly, and do the job right the first time. |
| DIY electrical work or code violations | Tried to save money with DIY electrical work or hired an unlicensed "handyman"? Now you're worried about safety and code compliance, especially with a home sale or insurance claim on the horizon. | We're fully licensed and insured. We'll assess your situation, bring everything up to code, and document it properly — so you can sell or file claims with confidence. |
