## Post 1: Educational — GFCI Safety

**Copy:**
Do you test your GFCI outlets monthly? You should.

Those outlets with the "test" and "reset" buttons in your kitchen and bathrooms are designed to protect you from electric shock. But they only work if they're working.

Here's how to test:
1. Press the "TEST" button
2. The outlet should shut off immediately
3. Press "RESET" to restore power

If it doesn't trip, or won't reset, call a licensed electrician. That's a safety issue.

Stay safe, Aurora.

Need an electrical safety inspection? Call us at 720-326-8492.

## Post 2: Educational — When to Upgrade Your Panel

**Copy:**
5 signs it's time to upgrade your electrical panel:

1. Frequent breaker trips (especially when running multiple appliances)
2. Your panel is 20+ years old
3. You're adding an EV charger or major appliance
4. Lights dim when AC kicks on
5. You still have a fuse box

Modern homes need modern electrical capacity. Your panel is the heart of your home's electrical system — if it can't keep up, everything suffers.

Thinking about an upgrade? We offer free estimates and transparent pricing.

Call 720-326-8492 or visit our website.

## Post 3: Educational — Outlet Safety

**Copy:**
Warm outlets = danger.

If you touch an outlet and it feels warm, or you notice brown/black discoloration around it, that's a warning sign of serious electrical problems.

DON'T IGNORE IT.

Loose connections, overloaded circuits, or faulty wiring can all cause heat buildup — and that can lead to electrical fires.

What to do:
- Unplug everything from that outlet immediately
- Don't use it until it's inspected
- Call a licensed electrician

Your safety is worth a service call.

## Post 7: Brand Story — Veteran-Owned

**Copy:**
Why I started Aim High Electrical Services.

After serving in the U.S. military, I knew I wanted to continue serving — just in a different way.

I saw too many homeowners frustrated with contractors who didn't show up, didn't communicate, and didn't do quality work. I knew I could do better.

At Aim High, we bring military discipline to every job:
- We show up on time
- We communicate clearly
- We do the job right the first time
- We treat your home with respect

That's the veteran standard.

Thanks for trusting us with your homes, Aurora.

## Post 8: Behind the Scenes — Job Completion

**Copy:**
Another successful panel upgrade in Aurora!

This homeowner was tripping breakers constantly — especially when charging their new EV and running the AC at the same time. Their 30-year-old panel just couldn't handle it.

We upgraded them to a modern 200-amp panel with plenty of capacity for their current needs and future upgrades.

Project completed in one day. Code-compliant. Clean workspace. Happy customer.

That's what we do.

Need an electrical upgrade? Call 720-326-8492.

Holiday season is coming! Don't let your electrical system ruin the magic.

Before you string up those lights:

- Check extension cords for fraying or damage
- Never daisy-chain more than 3 strands together
- Use outdoor-rated lights and cords for exterior displays
- Don't overload circuits (if breakers trip, you have too many lights)
- Consider having a dedicated outdoor circuit installed

Want to go big this year? We install permanent outdoor lighting and dedicated circuits for holiday displays.
