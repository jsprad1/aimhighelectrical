Your electrical panel is your home's heart. When it can't keep up, nothing works right — and worst case, it becomes a safety hazard.

- Licensed electrician with 4.9-star rating
- Properly sized panel for your home's actual needs

- Clean, code-compliant installation
- Same-day completion in most cases

Your home deserves a panel that works as hard as you do.

Neighbors, quick electrical safety tip as we head into spring:

After our Colorado winter, it's a good time to test your GFCI outlets. These are the outlets with "test" and "reset" buttons, usually in bathrooms, kitchens, garages, and outdoor areas.

Press the "test" button - power should cut off. Press "reset" - power should restore. If it doesn't work, that outlet isn't protecting you from electrical shock like it should.

This month, we're offering FREE whole-home electrical safety inspections ($149 value) with any service booking. We'll test every GFCI, check your panel, and identify any safety concerns.

I'm Glen with Aim High Electrical Services - veteran-owned, licensed & insured, and proud to serve Aurora neighborhoods. Call 720-326-8492 if you need help.

Stay safe out there.

Neighbors, storm season reminder:

When the power goes out, it's not just an inconvenience. It's also:
- Spoiled food in the fridge/freezer
- No AC during summer heat
- No heat if it's cold
- Medical equipment that needs power
- No way to charge phones or devices

A whole-home standby generator solves this. Automatic power within seconds of an outage.

This May, I'm offering FREE generator consultations (normally $150) and $200 OFF installation. I'll help you size the right system for your needs - no pressure, just expert advice.

I've installed generators for several families in our neighborhood. When the next storm hits, they'll be ready.

## 5. Nextdoor Recommendations

### Nextdoor Post 1 - Educational with Soft Offer (Mid-Campaign)
**Recommended Timing:** Mid-April
**Tone:** Helpful neighbor, educational, soft-sell

**Copy:**

**Subject:** Electrical safety tip for Aurora neighbors (and a special offer)

Hi neighbors,

I wanted to share something I've been seeing a lot lately in Aurora homes - it could affect you too.

Many homes built in the 70s, 80s, and 90s have Federal Pacific or Zinsco electrical panels. If you're not familiar with these brands, here's what you need to know: they're known fire hazards. The breakers often fail to trip when they should, which can lead to overheating and electrical fires.

How to check: Open your electrical panel (the metal box, usually in your garage, basement, or utility room). Look for the brand name inside. If it says "Federal Pacific Electric" or "FPE" with Stab-Lok breakers, or "Zinsco," you should consider replacing it.

I'm Glen with Aim High Electrical Services - I'm a veteran and licensed electrician serving Aurora. I've replaced dozens of these hazardous panels for neighbors throughout our area.

This spring, I'm running a promotion to help families get these safety upgrades done:
- April: $150 OFF panel upgrades
- May: FREE generator consultations + $200 OFF installation

No pressure - I'm always happy to answer questions about electrical safety whether you hire me or not. That's just being a good neighbor.

If you want an honest assessment of your panel, call me at 720-326-8492 or visit aimhighelectricalservices.com.

Stay safe out there.

### Nextdoor Post 2 - Storm Prep Community Service (May)
**Recommended Timing:** Early May
**Tone:** Community-focused, preparedness, helpful

**Copy:**

**Subject:** Is your neighborhood ready for Colorado storm season?

Hi neighbors,

Last May, you probably remember those severe storms that knocked out power across Aurora. Some families were without electricity for 2-3 days.

With storm season approaching again, I wanted to share some preparedness tips:

**If the power goes out, are you prepared?**
- Do you have flashlights with fresh batteries?
- Cooler with ice for medications and perishable food?
- Battery-powered radio for weather updates?
- Full tank of gas (gas pumps don't work without power)?
- Backup power for medical equipment if needed?

**For longer-term preparedness:**
A whole-home standby generator gives you automatic backup power within seconds of an outage. It's not just convenience - for families with medical equipment, food storage needs, or work-from-home requirements, it's essential.

This May, I'm offering FREE generator consultations (I'll help you understand your options and sizing) plus $200 OFF professional installation. I've installed generators for several families right here in Aurora, and when the next storm hits, they'll be ready.

I'm Glen with Aim High Electrical Services - veteran-owned, licensed & insured, 4.9-star rated. I've been serving our Aurora community since 2023.

Whether you need a generator, panel upgrade, or just have electrical safety questions, I'm here to help.

Call 720-326-8492 or visit aimhighelectricalservices.com

Let's make sure our neighborhood is storm-ready this year.
