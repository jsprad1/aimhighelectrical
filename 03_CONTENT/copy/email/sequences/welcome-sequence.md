Hi [First Name],

Thanks for reaching out to Aim High Electrical Services. We're honored that you're considering us for your electrical needs.

I'm Glen, owner and founder. I'm a U.S. military veteran, and I started Aim High because I saw too many homeowners getting let down by unreliable contractors. I bring the same discipline and commitment to electrical work that I learned in service — which means showing up on time, communicating clearly, and doing the job right.

**Here's what happens next:**

1. If you requested an estimate, I'll personally review your information and reach out within 24 hours to schedule an assessment.
2. We'll visit your home at a time that works for you, assess the work, and provide a transparent quote.
3. Once approved, we'll schedule the work and complete it professionally — with no surprises.

In the meantime, I'll be sending you some helpful tips for maintaining your home's electrical system and spotting potential issues before they become emergencies.

Have a question? Just reply to this email or call me directly at 720-326-8492.

Looking forward to serving you,

Hi [First Name],

Glen here from Aim High Electrical Services. I wanted to share some quick electrical safety tips that every Aurora homeowner should know. These simple checks can help you spot problems early — before they become emergencies.

**5 Electrical Safety Checks for Your Home:**

**1. Test Your GFCI Outlets Monthly**
Those outlets with the "test" and "reset" buttons in your kitchen and bathrooms? They're life-savers. Press "test" monthly to make sure they're working. If they don't trip, call an electrician.

**2. Watch for Warm or Discolored Outlets**
If an outlet feels warm to the touch or has brown/black discoloration around it, that's a serious warning sign. Unplug everything and call us immediately at 720-326-8492.

**3. Don't Ignore Flickering Lights**
One flickering bulb? Probably just the bulb. Multiple flickering lights? Could be loose wiring, which is a fire hazard. Let's check it out.

**4. Know Your Panel's Age**
If your electrical panel is 20+ years old and still has circuit breakers (or worse, fuses), it's time for an upgrade. Modern homes need modern electrical capacity.

**5. Never Overload Outlets**
Using power strips daisy-chained together? That's an electrical fire waiting to happen. If you're constantly out of outlets, you need more circuits — we can help.

**Concerned about something in your home?** Call me at 720-326-8492 for a free safety assessment.

Stay safe,

**Glen**
