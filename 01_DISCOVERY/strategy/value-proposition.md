## Why Choose Aim High Over...

### ...A National Franchise (Mr. Electric, Mister Sparky)?
"You get the same professional quality without the corporate markup. Glen personally oversees your project — you're not a ticket number. Same expertise, more personal, better value."

### ...A Random Independent Electrician?
"You get the reliability of a business built on military values, backed by a 4.9-star track record. We show up on time, communicate clearly, and deliver consistent quality — not a gamble."

### ...Doing It Yourself?
"Electrical work requires a license and permits for a reason. One mistake can cause a fire, void your insurance, or fail an inspection. We handle it safely, to code, with a professional result."

### ...Home Depot / Lowe's Installation?
"You get a relationship with your actual electrician, not a subcontractor you've never met. We handle complex work they can't — panels, generators, EV chargers — and we stand behind it."
