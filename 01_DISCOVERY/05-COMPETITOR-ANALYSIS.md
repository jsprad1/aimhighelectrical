## Competitive Positioning

### Market Gaps (Where Aim High Can Win)

1. **Veteran-owned storytelling** — No major competitor in the area leads with a veteran brand story. This is a powerful trust differentiator, especially in Aurora's veteran community.

2. **Modern services focus** — Most local independents don't emphasize EV charging and smart home. Aim High can own this niche as Colorado's EV market explodes.

3. **Professional digital presence** — Many local competitors have outdated or no websites. Aim High's modern landing page stands out in search results.

4. **Mid-market pricing sweet spot** — Between expensive franchises and cheap independents, Aim High can compete on value (quality + reasonable price).

5. **Google Business Profile opportunity** — If competitors have weak GBP profiles, Aim High can dominate local search with a fully optimized listing.

6. **Nextdoor dominance** — Aurora suburbs are active on Nextdoor. Few electricians invest in this platform strategically.

### Threats (Where Competitors Are Strong)

1. **Brand recognition gap** — Franchises have decades of name recognition; Aim High is 3 years old.

2. **Review volume** — Established competitors may have hundreds of Google reviews vs. Aim High's early-stage count.

3. **24/7 availability** — Franchises offer round-the-clock emergency service that a small operation may not match.

4. **Marketing budgets** — National franchises spend heavily on Google Ads, SEO, and TV/radio, making it expensive to compete for keywords.

5. **Capacity constraints** — Larger companies can handle more simultaneous jobs and offer faster scheduling.

## Recommended Differentiation Strategy

### Primary Positioning
**"Aurora's veteran-owned electrical experts — bringing military precision to every home."**

Position Aim High in the space between expensive national franchises and unreliable cheap contractors. Lead with trust (veteran-owned), prove with results (4.9 stars), and differentiate with modern services (EV, smart home).

### Tactical Recommendations

1. **Own the veteran angle everywhere** — Profile bios, Google Business description, Nextdoor, every ad. This is the single strongest differentiator.

2. **Build Google review volume fast** — Aim for 50+ Google reviews in the next 6 months. Ask every satisfied customer. This closes the gap with established competitors.

3. **Dominate "EV charger installation Aurora CO"** — Low competition keyword, high-growth market, Aim High already offers the service. Create dedicated landing page content.

4. **Invest in Nextdoor over Facebook** — Aurora homeowners use Nextdoor heavily for contractor recommendations. Be active, helpful, and visible there.

5. **Create educational content** — "Is your panel safe?" guides, "EV charging 101" articles. Positions Aim High as the expert, not just another electrician.

6. **Partner locally** — Real estate agents need pre-sale electrical inspections. Home inspectors refer panel upgrade work. General contractors need electrical subs for basement finishes.

7. **Offer a guarantee** — Match franchise-level confidence: "100% satisfaction guaranteed" or "we'll make it right." Removes risk for first-time customers.
