## Understanding Your Needs

### Current Situation
- Veteran-owned electrical business established January 2023

- Service area: Aurora, Centennial, Parker, Highlands Ranch

### Challenges
1. Limited online visibility beyond HomeAdvisor (no Google Business Profile optimization, no SEO)
2. No active social media presence (placeholder links only)
3. Lead generation dependent on HomeAdvisor and word-of-mouth
4. No contact form on website (phone/email only — form now added)
5. No review generation system beyond HomeAdvisor
6. No paid advertising presence (Google Ads, local services)

### Goals
1. Generate 10-25 qualified leads per month from digital channels
2. Build Google review presence (50+ reviews in 6 months)
3. Establish consistent brand visibility in Aurora local search
4. Reduce dependency on HomeAdvisor for lead generation
5. Create scalable marketing foundation for business growth
